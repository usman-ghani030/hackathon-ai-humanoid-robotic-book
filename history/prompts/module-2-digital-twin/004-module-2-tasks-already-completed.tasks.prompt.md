# Module 2 Tasks Already Completed

## PROMPT_TEXT
implement all module 2 tasks

## RESPONSE_TEXT
All Module 2 tasks have already been completed successfully. The implementation includes:

- Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - All 45 tasks completed
- Content covers physics simulation, Unity interaction, and sensor simulation
- Files: `gazebo-simulation.md`, `unity-rendering.md`, `simulated-sensors.md`
- All tasks in specs/002-digital-twin/tasks.md are marked as completed ([x])

The module includes comprehensive content on:
- Physics-based simulation with Gazebo
- High-fidelity interaction with Unity
- Simulated perception systems
- Multi-modal planning
- Integration with perception systems
- Advanced AI integration

All content is properly formatted for Docusaurus with appropriate frontmatter and is ready for deployment.

## OUTCOME
Module 2 implementation was already complete with all tasks marked as completed.

## EVALUATION
Confirmed that all module 2 tasks were already completed as evidenced by the fully implemented content files and completed task markers in the tasks.md file. All requirements for the digital twin module have been satisfied.
