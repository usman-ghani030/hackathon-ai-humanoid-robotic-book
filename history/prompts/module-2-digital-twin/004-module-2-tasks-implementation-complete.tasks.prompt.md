# Module 2 Tasks Implementation Complete

## PROMPT_TEXT
implement all module 2 tasks

## RESPONSE_TEXT
All Module 2 tasks have been successfully implemented. The implementation includes:

1. Physics-Based Simulation with Gazebo chapter - Comprehensive content covering rigid-body dynamics, gravity modeling, collision detection, and world modeling with Gazebo.

2. High-Fidelity Interaction with Unity chapter - Detailed content on visual realism, human-robot interaction, scene control, and integration with perception systems using Unity.

3. Simulated Perception Systems chapter - Complete coverage of LiDAR, depth camera, and IMU simulation, sensor fusion, reality gap considerations, and synthetic data generation.

All tasks in the tasks.md file have been marked as completed, and the actual content has been created in the appropriate files with proper Docusaurus formatting and concept-level explanations appropriate for the target audience.

## OUTCOME
Module 2 implementation complete with all tasks marked as completed and all content properly created.

## EVALUATION
All Module 2 tasks successfully implemented with comprehensive content created for all three required chapters, including proper Docusaurus formatting and concept-level explanations.
