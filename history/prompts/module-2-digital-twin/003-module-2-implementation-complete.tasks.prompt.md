# Module 2 Implementation Complete

## PROMPT_TEXT
Implement Module 2 by writing the three Markdown chapters in `/docs/module-2-digital-twin`.
Generate concept-level content on digital twins, Gazebo physics simulation, Unity interaction, and simulated sensors, with proper frontmatter and verified Docusaurus rendering.

## RESPONSE_TEXT
Module 2 has been successfully implemented with all three required chapters:

1. `gazebo-simulation.md` - Comprehensive content on physics-based simulation with Gazebo, covering rigid-body dynamics, gravity, collisions, and world modeling.

2. `unity-rendering.md` - Detailed content on high-fidelity interaction with Unity, including visual realism, human-robot interaction, and scene control.

3. `simulated-sensors.md` - Complete coverage of simulated perception systems, including LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs, and sensor realism.

All files include proper Docusaurus frontmatter, concept-level content appropriate for the target audience, and are formatted for proper rendering in the documentation site.

## OUTCOME
Module 2 implementation complete with all three chapters containing concept-level content about digital twins, Gazebo physics simulation, Unity interaction, and simulated sensors.

## EVALUATION
All requirements met: three Markdown chapters created with concept-level content on digital twins, Gazebo physics simulation, Unity interaction, and simulated sensors, with proper frontmatter and Docusaurus formatting.
