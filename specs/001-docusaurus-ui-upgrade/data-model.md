# Data Model: Docusaurus UI Upgrade

## Overview
This feature focuses on UI/UX improvements and does not introduce new data entities. The existing Docusaurus content structure remains unchanged as specified in FR-006.

## Entities
This feature does not introduce any new data entities. The existing Docusaurus data model remains unchanged:
- Documentation content (markdown/mdx files)
- Site configuration
- Navigation structure
- User preferences (if any existing)

## Data Flow
No changes to data flow or processing. All content continues to be processed through the existing Docusaurus pipeline.

## State Management
No new state management required. Any UI state (like mobile menu open/close) will be handled through existing Docusaurus mechanisms or React component state.
